Beartype **forward reference factories** (i.e.,  low-level callables creating
and returning forward reference proxy subclasses deferring the resolution of a
stringified type hint referencing an attribute that has yet to be defined and
annotating a class or callable decorated by the :func:`beartype.beartype`
decorator).

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

    Create and return a new **subscriptable forward reference subclass** (i.e.,

    base class (ABC) deferring the resolution of the unresolved type hint with

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint_name : str
        Relative (i.e., unqualified) or absolute (i.e., fully-qualified) name of
        this unresolved type hint to be proxied.
    scope_name : str
        Possibly ignored fully-qualified name of the lexical scope in which this
        unresolved type hint was originally declared. For example:

        * ``"some_package.some_module"`` for a module scope (e.g., to
          resolve a global class or callable against this scope).
        * ``"some_package.some_module.SomeClass"`` for a class scope (e.g.,
          to resolve a nested class or callable against this scope).

    Returns
    -------
    type[BeartypeForwardRefSubbableABC]
        Subscriptable forward reference proxy subclass proxying this type hint.

    Raises
    ------
    BeartypeDecorHintForwardRefException
        If either ``hint_name`` or ``scope_name`` are *not* syntactically valid
        ``"."``-delimited Python identifiers.

    Create and return a new **forward reference subclass** (i.e., concrete

    resolution of the type hint with the passed name).

    This factory is internally memoized for efficiency.

    Caveats
    -------
    **There is an unresolvable syntactic disambiguity between the following two
    competing use cases:**

    * When ``hint_name`` is an absolute forward reference (e.g.,
      ``"muh_package.muh_submodule.MuhType"``). In this case, the
      ``type_module_name`` local variable internally defined in the body of
      this factory is a valid module name.
    * When ``hint_name`` is a relative forward reference to a nested type (e.g.,
      ``"MuhOuterType.MuhInnerType"``). In this case, ``type_module_name`` is
      non-empty but *not* a valid module name.

      Thankfully, nested types are entirely useless in Python and thus
      *extremely* uncommon in real-world code. The latter use case is thus
      largely ignorable (but still regrettable).

      In theory, these two cases could be disambiguated in the body of this
      factory by calling the :func:`.is_module` tester below like so:

      .. code-block:: python

         if not (
             type_module_name and
             is_module(type_module_name)
         ):

      In practice, doing so would be ill-advised. The whole point of forward
      references is to defer module importation until *after* this early
      decoration time. Importing arbitrary third-party modules at this early
      decoration time would increase the likelihood of real-world issues in
      production code *far* more severe than this syntactic ambiguity.

      Lastly, note that third-party downstream consumers do have options here.
      To avoid this syntactic ambiguity, users intending to create forward
      references to nested types should either prefer unquoted forward
      references under Python >= 3.14 *or* instantiate
      :class:`.typing.ForwardRef` objects passed the ``module`` parameter: e.g.,

      .. code-block:: python

         # Instead of this ambiguous awfulness...
         is_bearable(['ok'], list['MuhInnerType.MuhOuterType'])

         # ...users should do this under Python >= 3.14:
         from typing import ForwardRef
         is_bearable(['ok'], list[MuhInnerType.MuhOuterType])

         # ...or this under Python <= 3.14:
         from typing import ForwardRef
         is_bearable(['ok'], list[ForwardRef(
             'MuhInnerType.MuhOuterType', module=__name__])

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint_name : str
        Absolute (i.e., fully-qualified) or relative (i.e., unqualified) name of
        this unresolved type hint to be proxied.
    scope_name : str
        Possibly ignored fully-qualified name of the lexical scope in which this
        unresolved type hint was originally declared. See also
        :func:`.make_forwardref_subbable_subtype` for further details.
    type_bases : Tuple[type, ...]
        Tuple of all base classes to be inherited by this forward reference
        subclass. For simplicity, this *must* be a 1-tuple ``(type_base,)``
        where ``type_base`` is a :class:`.BeartypeForwardRefSubbableABC`
        subclass.

    Returns
    -------
    BeartypeForwardRef
        Forward reference proxy subclass proxying this type hint.

    Raises
    ------
    BeartypeDecorHintForwardRefException
        If either ``hint_name`` or ``scope_name`` are *not* syntactically valid
        ``"."``-delimited Python identifiers.

**Forward reference proxy cache** (i.e., dictionary mapping from the tuple of
all parameters passed to each prior call of the
:func:`._make_forwardref_subtype` factory function to the forward reference
proxy dynamically created and returned by that call).

This cache serves a dual purpose. Notably, this cache both enables:

* External callers to iterate over all previously instantiated forward reference
  proxies. This is particularly useful when responding to module reloading,
  which requires that *all* previously cached types be uncached.
* :func:`._make_forwardref_subtype` to internally memoize itself over its
  passed parameters. Since the existing ``callable_cached`` decorator could
  trivially do so as well, however, this is only a negligible side effect.
